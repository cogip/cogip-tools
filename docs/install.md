# Setup

There are two ways to setup the environment to develop and run the tools.

- The [Manual method](#manual-method) requires to configure the environment on the development computer and to run tools one by one.
This method also briefly explains how to build the firmware for the real MCU.

- The [Docker method](#docker-method) provides a complete Docker Compose stack that configure, compile and run each tool using only one command.

To prepare SDCards for Raspberry Pi SDCards for robots and beacon, refer to the [Raspberry Pi OS section](raspios.md).

##Â Common Setup

### OS

Linux only.

Tested on Ubuntu 23.04 (with Xorg instead of Wayland for proper display of the Monitor).

### Debian packages

```bash
sudo apt install python3 git build-essential
```

### Git Submodules

The simulation tools depend on the compatible version of [cogip/mcu-firmware](https://github.com/cogip/mcu-firmware) which also depends on a specific version of [RIOT-OS/RIOT](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT). So to avoid struggle in finding the correct versions of the dependencies, we use git submodules to fix the versions of `mcu-firmware` and `RIOT`.
Do not forget to fetch the submodules after `git clone`:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

## Manual Method

### Python

Python 3.11+ is required.

### Debian packages

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-venv libxcb-xinerama0 socat protobuf-compiler build-essential swig cmake pkg-config
```

### Build mcu-firmware

See the `Requirements` section of `submodules/mcu-firmware/README.md` to setup the build environment.

Use the following command to build the native version of the firmware:

#### Native build

```bash
make -C submodules/mcu-firmware/applications/cup2023 BOARD=cogip-native
```

#### ARM build

Use the following command to build the ARM version of the firmware:

```bash
make -C submodules/mcu-firmware/applications/cup2023 BOARD=cogip-board-ng
```

### Installation

All tools can be install on the development PC.

!!! note "Python 3.11 or more is required."

To setup a new environment, create a virtual env and install the package in dev mode:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
pip install -e .[dev]
```

!!! note "The `dev` optional dependencies include packages used to run Monitor and emulate COGIP tools on the development platform."

`mcu-firmware` and all Python tools can be run on the development PC.
In this case, we have to create virtual serial ports to simulation the serial link between STM32 and Raspberry Pi:

```bash
socat pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/ttySTM32 pty,raw,echo=0,link=/tmp/ttyRPI
```

Native firmware is then run using:

```bash
make -C submodules/mcu-firmware/applications/cup2023 BOARD=cogip-native PORT="-c /dev/null -c /tmp/ttySTM32" term
```

!!! note "In RIOT, `-c` option specifies serial ports to use. First port being used for the shell, it is not configurable, so we just pass `/dev/null`."

`Server` is run using:

```bash
cogip-server
```

`Dashboard` is run using:

```bash
cogip-dashboard
```

`Planner` is run using:

```bash
cogip-planner
```

`Copilot` is run using:

```bash
cogip-copilot -p /tmp/ttyRPI
```

`Detector` is run using:

```bash
cogip-detector
```

`RobotCam` is run using:

```bash
cogip-robotcam
```

And finally `Monitor` for robot 1 is launched using:

```bash
cogip-monitor http://localhost:8091
```

The `Dashboard` for robot 1 is accessible using a web browser at `http://localhost:8081`.

### Linting and Formatting

While installing the `dev` environment, `ruff` and `pre-commit` package have been installed.

To run `ruff` manually, just run:

```bash
ruff check [--fix]
ruff format
```

To enable pre-commit hooks prevent committing code not respecting linting and formatting rules, run:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

### Packaging

To build a source distribution package, use:

```bash
python setup.py sdist
```

This will produce `dist/cogip-tools-1.0.0.tar.gz`.

This package can be copied to the Raspberry Pi and installed to deploy the Python tools:

```bash
pip install cogip-tools-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

## Docker Method

### Docker Installation

See [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### X Server

The `Monitor` is working with X11 but does not behave correctly with Wayland.

To allow the `Monitor` process running in a Docker container to access the X Server running on the host,
you need to run the following command in a terminal:

`$ xhost +local:`

### Configuration

The configuration of the tools is done by setting environment variables in the `.env` file.

All variables supported by the tools are forwarded inside Docker containers.

### Compose Profiles

Several profiles are defined to select which containers to run:

- `robot1`: for robot 1 containers
- `robot2`: for robot 2 containers
- `monitor`: for `Monitor` container

The beacon containers are always started.

Profiles are set in the `.env` file:

`COMPOSE_PROFILES=robot1,robot2,monitor`

### Build Images

Build Docker images:

`docker compose build`

### Run All Tools

Start the Compose stack:

`docker compose up`
